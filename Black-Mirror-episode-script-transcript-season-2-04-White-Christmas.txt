What are you doing?

01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,480
Roast potatoes.

13
:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
- We're doing Christmas.
- Christmas.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Christmas Day, December 25th.
You've heard of it?

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,440
No work today, so, uh...
the bottle's on the table.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,480
I know we didn't have
decorations last year.
But, uh...

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
I couldn't find them
last year.

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,880
They're only supposed
to have stored essentials here.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think it's kind of adorable
someone thinks tinsel is
essential.

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,400
I figured it'd be good for us
to have a... a meal.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,240
A drink. Talk?

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,120
- Good for you or me?
- Come on. What has it been,

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,840
five years? How many sentences
have you said to me? Three?

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,440
- [sighs]
- I mean,
I'm exaggerating... a little.

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,960
But, come on, there is a little
bit of a conversational drought
happening here.

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,760
- My ears need water.
- I'm not big on conversation.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,960
- Practice makes perfect.
- Maybe I'll bore you.

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,320
Buddy, look, at this point,

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,800
being bored by anything other
than snow would be a relief.

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,320
So come on.

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
Chit-chat.

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,880
Conversate, something.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Come on, for me.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,000
- For Christmas.
- What do you want
to talk about?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,640
Why are you here?

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,400
No one ends up here

37
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,800
without things going to total
shit for them back out there.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
It's a job, not a jail.

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,880
often one
and the same thing.

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,600
So...

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,040
...-what went wrong
for you out there?

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,520
Nothing.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
Bullshit.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
It's not an interrogation.

45
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,360
What about you?

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,160
An icebreaker.
You're learning.

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,400
- What went to shit for you?
- Sure you don't want
that drink?

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,200
Did you talk
your way into trouble?

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,880
In a roundabout way.

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,960
I talked to people.

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
- Made money from it.
- Why? What were you?

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Some sort of, um,
Los Angeles drive-time DJ?

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,840
I was not a Dd.

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
More like a guru.

55
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,120
Oh, don't say you were
a spiritual guru.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,440
I was decidedly not
a spiritual guru.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
[musical notification]

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,760
[man] Hello, Harry.
I'm patched through now.
How are you doing?

59
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,720
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

[Harry] Sorry,
I'm not quite dressed yet.

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,560
[man] Don't worry,
that's why I'm here.

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,200
Just show me what
you're planning on wearing

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
and we'll take things
from there.

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,400
- How about this?
- Doesn't work.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,560
It's boring blue and you're
not boring blue. Not tonight.

65
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,440
All right.
Which one of these is good?

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
Like I said,
white shirt with a black tie

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,000
with a slim-cut grey jacket.

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,040
Classic, timeless. Smart.

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,520
- I don't usually do jackets.
You don't usually do anything.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,280
And sort out that hair,
because...

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,280
OK. [exhales]

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,840
Remember those breathing
techniques we talked about, OK?

73
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,240
You're going to do fine.

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,600
It's going to be fine.

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,760
[loud music playing]

716
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
[indistinct chattering]

77
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,320
- She's cute.
- Yes.

78
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,160
Not out loud.

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,880
Absolutely.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,040
You need to pick your spots when
you want to talk out loud. OK?

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,280
OK. The function room
is in the back.

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,360
Trust me, if you walk
in there like you belong,

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,360
- no one's going
to say anything.
- OK.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,000
So what were you running,
some corporate espionage outfit?

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,480
Romantic services.

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,600
Boy meets girl thanks to...

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,400
...in-the-field assistance.

88
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,960
You coached dorks whilst
they cruised singles bars.

89
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,200
Singles bars are depressing.
We'd do regular bars and clubs.

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,360
But at Christmas time...

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
...we'd gate-crash
office parties.

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,840
See, there's this dynamic
to Christmas work parties.

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,240
All the attractive women

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800

have been surrounded by
regulation office ass-clowns

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,120
for the whole year, and now they
want to let their hair down.

96
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,080
According to the pop
psychologist.

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,360
So I know how the mind works.

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
[man] Now, don't stand
around like a lamppost.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,960
Walk over to the bar.

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
Remember. Always move
with purpose.

101
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,600
[indistinct chattering]

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,480
- [woman] Yeah, who's next?
- Yeah. Can I have a...?

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,920
Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke
and a shot of tequila.

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,640
[scoffs] Yeah. Don't worry
about him, all right?

105
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,720
Just grab one of those
empty bottles off the bar

orders his piss water.

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,720
We're just going to need it
for a prop anyway.

108
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
Have a look around.

109
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,920
See anything you like?

110
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
What? The blonde?

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,280
The dark-haired girl?

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Interesting choice. Go straight
over, but focus on the blonde.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
Now. Come on.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Confidence. You can do this.

115
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,240
Hold on, just finding
out who they are.

116
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
OK, uh, bullshit opener.

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,000
Um, try the horse story.
At the blonde girl.
118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,440
[clears throat]

119
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,040
Hey, so, did anyone see that guy
outside riding the horse?

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,880
- Did you see him?
- What? A guy on a horse?

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,760
Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago,
this guy, shirtless,

122
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,520
- riding a horse
down the high street.
- Really?

123
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,480
Yeah, honestly. He, uh...

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,200
The weirdest part was that
he had a bow and arrow, right?

125
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,720
- What? A real bow and arrow?
- I swear to God.

126
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,400
He probably did it for a bet
but he looked like something
out of Tolkien,

127
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,120
- you know?
- [both laugh]

128
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,640
- Sorry, who are you?
- [nervous chuckle]

until I find something.

130
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm pretty sure I'm me.

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Just you're not
from the office.

132
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,280
Who do you know from here?

133
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,080
Say, "I know you." Friendly.

134
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
I know you, for one.

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,480
- Dawson.
- Dawson, isn't it?

136
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,880
You met at Kath's barbecue.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah. We met at
Kath's barbecue back in...

138
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,200
- June.
- ...June or so. Yeah.

139
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
He had a pork pie hat.

140
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,440
You had a poor guy's hat.

A "pork pie hat.”

142
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,280
A pork pie hat that
you wore on your head.

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
He'll pretend he remembers,
even though

144
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,240
he won't actually
know if he does.

145
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,560
- Right.
- Yeah?

146
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,760
Yeah, sorry.

147
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,280
No. No, no worries.
No worries. Crazy night.

148
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,320
You're doing fine.
Don't neglect the blonde.

149
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,880
You, I don't know.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
- Um, Amy.
- Amy. Hi.

151
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,200
Get her to introduce you
to the dark-haired girl.

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,000
[clears throat] So, uh, are all
of your friends this suspicious?

153
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,000
- Nice.
- I don't think so.

154
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,880
- [Harry] Yeah?
- This is Jennifer.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,440
- Hi, Jennifer.
- Hi.

156
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,960
Now focus on Amy and we'll do
that funny material that we
worked on.

157
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Anyway, this guy gets off
the horse and he's got
a backpack, right?

158
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,280
The tactic,
generally, was to deliberately

159
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,560
freeze out the one you were
actually interested in.

160
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,640
For one thing you
wouldn't seem needy but...

161
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,160
...also they would, most times,
sort of lean in naturally.

162
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,440
People want to be noticed.

163
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,800
They don't like to be shut out.
It makes them feel invisible.

164
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,760
But this girl...

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,480
This girl seemed content
with being ignored.

166
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,360
Maybe she could
smell a loser.

167
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
No.

168
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,800
No. She was an outsider.

169
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,600
An attractive outsider.

170
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,800
And there's nothing more
tantalising than that.

171
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,360
[indistinct chatter]

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,880
- Huh.
- [Harry] Great.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, she's off. OK.

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,080
Gonna be a challenge.
Don't quit.

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,280
Let's let our friend Amy here
yadder on for a little while

176
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,440
and then, uh,
find an excuse to slip away.

177
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,040
They will sit outside
on the balcony till,
like, four in the morning.

178
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,840
[Harry] Yeah?
It's startling.

179
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,440
Listen, I've just go
to the, um, little boys' room.

180
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,200
So, uh, just keep the party
going and I'll,

181
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,040
- you know... [laughs]
- Sure.
182

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,760
Do you actually have to go?

183
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, but it's not
easy with you watching.

184
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,000
I promise. I won't peek.

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,560
So you streamed everything
he saw, and he trusted you
with that?
186
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,520
Well...
it was only me watching.

187
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,800
Jesus, how much urine? He's
pissing like a harpooned cow.

188
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,240
- It's making me want to go.
- [all laughing]

189
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,840
[man] Well, it is!

190
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,680
OK, there's our girl.
Um, all right, Harry.

191
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,560
Your best bet is to just go over
and start talking to her.

192
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
You just want
to establish a rapport.

193
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,200
OK? Don't be scared of her.

194
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
OK, guys, any observations so
far, helping our man out here?

195
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,480
Here's what's interesting,
she's pretty but, uh,
no one's hitting on her.

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,160
[man 1] Probably means
they've given up.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

197
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,200
[man 2] She always gives them
the brush-off cos...

198
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
They're regular types, she's an
outsider with zero in common.

199
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
- OK that's a possible in.
- [exhales]

200
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Harry, engage in conversation,
but be cynical.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,640
Right? Cutting.

202
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,480
Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
You two against the world.

203
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Confidence. Confidence.
Just talk to her.

204
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I don't really get parties.

205
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
You know, you just kind of turn
up and it's, uh, it's enforced
fun, all night.

206
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,800
Talk about what TV shows
you've fallen behind on.

207
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,120
Pretend to be happy.

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Maybe everyone else enjoys it,
maybe it's just me?

209
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
It's definitely
not just you.

210
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,360
All right, good start. Now do
some more outsider small talk.

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,920
And keep looking at her.
I need to gauge her reactions.

212
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,520
So I noticed you sitting
alone on the edge and I, uh...

213
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,920
I thought,
"Hey, kindred spirit."

214
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
I really hate when people say
"kindred spirit", you know.

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,680
And people that do that.

216
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,000
- Me too.
- [chuckles]

217
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,480
Yeah, I guess you don't
really like parties either.

218
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
The noise wrecks it for me.
219
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,200
All the talking and talking,
it never fucking stops.

220
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,280
OK, she curses,
so should you.

221
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,840
Shit, fucking, I fucking always
totally think that it's fucking
shit. You know?

222
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,880
I can't think through
all the babble.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I only got through it last year
because I was on drugs.

224
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,840
[laughs]

225
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,640
I'm sorry, what's that?
What's that?

226
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
Just, like, pills, but

227
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,200
they must've been pretty strong
because I actually enjoyed
myself.

228
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
- That's cool.
- Don't say cool.

229
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,760
- I wish I had some drugs
right now.

- No, you don't.

230
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm just... I'm joking.
231

00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,200
I don't take them anymore.

232
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,640
- Say, "That's good.”
- That's good,
because you don't...

233
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,640
You don't need that
shit in your system, no.

234
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,880
I'd say she's a level four
rock chick.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,960
Semi-reformed. Probably respond
well to spiritual conversation.

236
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,040
I don't think I can face
fucking weeks of that.
I might bail, boys.

237
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,000
OK, look,

it's too public here.

238
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Ask if you can move someplace
quieter, where you can really
talk.

239
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,080
People want to be heard.
That's why 90 per cent of
seduction is just listening.
240
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,160
[man] Or at least pulling
a face like you're listening.

241
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
Yeah, that works, too.

242
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,760
The important thing
is to make them feel important.

243
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
Like they can make you want to
extinguish the rest of the world

244
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,160
and focus on them.

245
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,200
Full attention.

246
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Like you're not giving me now.
What's wrong?

247
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
- That clock.
- What about it?

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,600
I just... I just never

noticed it before.

249
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,600
[scoffs] In five years? Jesus.

250
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,440
Anyway, the point is to stay
locked in on them long enough

251
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,280
to build a rapport.

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,120
So, well, I would guess
that either every guy in there

253
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,960
has already tried to hit on you
or, uh, maybe they find you too
intimidating.

254
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,760
- Am I intimidating?
- No, no, no, no, no.
I'm just, uh...

255
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
No, I just imagine that
they all kind of want
to get in inside your...

256
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,600
- Head.
- ...head.

257
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,200
[chuckles]
Some of them have tried.

258
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,280
Not directly.

259
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,120
They send messages,
or they make it so you know
what they're thinking.

260
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
Yeah. That can't be fun.

261
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,240

- ...Magson Frank.

- Three years.

So three Christmas parties.

268

This will be my last.

- Mm-hm.

I've been planning it forever,
but you know what it's like.

271
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
You know you have to do it, but
when it comes right down to it,

272
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
it's hard
to work up the courage.

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,040
You can empathize with that.

274
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,320
Yeah. It's like when you want
to jump into a pool,

275
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
and you're worried that
the water's going to be cold.

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,320
But you know moments after you
jump in that it'll be fine.

277
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,800
It's the fear of the shock
that holds you back.

278
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,640
Ultimately, the only thing
you're worried about is
the transition

279
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,840
from one state to another.

280
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,600
And that can't hurt you
because it's... it's just
a state change.

281
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,280
Great stuff, kid.
Almost word-for-word.

282
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,320
That's exactly right,
it's just a state change.

283
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,040
Right. And it's
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

frustrating because

284
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
you've always got these ten
voices in your head saying,
"Don't do it"

285
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,040
and another ten in your head
saying, "Do it".

286
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,200
Which one do you listen to?

287
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,520
The "do it"s.

288
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,320
Really?

289
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560
Yeah. If you don't like it, you
can just cut and run, you know.

290
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,320
Get it over and done with.

00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,400
You're right. I will.

another drink.

I want you
to come back to mine.

321

I thought about asking you, and
a little voice said, "Do it".

So I'm doing it.

00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Using party tricks to pick up
girls isn't "knowing minds.”

482
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,640
The picking up girls thing
was a hobby.

483
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,000
My job
was completely different.

484
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,120
You'll never guess
what that was.

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,880
- Marketing person?
- No.

486
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,640
- Door-to-door salesman?
- Please.

487
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Proctologist?

488
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,560
- You're never going to get it.
- I'm not going to try.

489
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,840
All right.
Let's make it a game.

490
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,560
T'll describe to you...

491
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,520
-.-my day at work, and you stop
me when you've guessed it.

[man on TV] The extreme weather
has hit sales hard this

Five inches of snow...

494
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,240
[woman thinking] That's going
to wreck my portfolio just when
I need it.

[sighs]

496
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,120
Don't know what
I'm going to do about that.

497
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,000
Oh, God, more messages.
I'll never clear this inbox.

498
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,320
sorry.
Constant bloody admin.

499
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,880
Just time
for a little snack.

OK, enough. Stop thinking about

Nowhere. [chuckles]

into a client's brain.

816
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,840
That day, I didn't go to work.
I just stayed at home and...

817
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,240
...tried to work out
how to make amends.

818
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,560
But she just
didn't come back.

819
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,080
And thanks to the block,
I couldn't...

820
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,560
I couldn't message her.
I couldn't call her.

I was pretty desperate.

822
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,360
So I just hung around outside

Um, she left.

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,280

830
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,840
- Joe!
- No, leave him.

831
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,720
I was still hopeful
that she would get in touch,

832
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,240
or at least remove the block
so that I could contact her.

833
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,520
But no.

I go within ten metres of her,

I've got absolutely no way

Except, um,
I knew where her dad lived.

so I knew that she would
definitely be there.

871
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,560
So, the day before,
Christmas Eve, I headed up.

01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,960
That she just...
she just stayed in the house.

976
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,160
It was, um...

977
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,080
It was Christmas Eve,
so she just...

978
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,840
...she just stayed hidden.
She didn't move.

979
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,040
Then on Boxing Day she realised
that no one was going to help.

980
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,440
Then she, um, gave her grandad
a present that she'd made.

981
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,280
And she went out
to go and get help.

982
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,880
How far did she get?

983
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,160
May God forgive me.
God forgive me.

984
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,760
So you confess?

985
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,840
Joe?

986
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,440
Just say it.

987
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,880
Just let it out.

988
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,960
I confess. I confess.

989
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,960
[whimpering]

990
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,840
Whoo! I knew I could do it.

991
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,320
Boom! I told you I'd get it.

992
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,920
All right, I'm coming out.

993
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,200
Sorry, Joe.
994
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,720
[exhales deeply]

995
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,320
Well? That had to be enough.

996
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,200
Full confession.
Clear conviction.

997
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,960
Well done.

998
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,720
Two days we pressed him
and he said piss all,

999
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,960
this bastard cracks him
in 70 minutes.

1000
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,880
He knows he's guilty,
he needed to unload.

1001
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,720
It wasn't really 70 minutes,

not to him.

1002
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,400
When he was first ingested,
I tweaked the time preferences,

1003
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,800
made it seem like five years

from his perspective.

1004
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,920
Some might say that five years
with me is punishment enough.

1005
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,400

Wait here.

1006
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,120
Mr Potter.

1007
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,360
Congratulations
on your confession.

1008
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,200
That cookie we took out
of your head just gave us
the full story.

1009
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,240
So you can keep the silent act
up as long as you want.

1010
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,320
Makes no difference,
you've already talked.

1011
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,240
Also, Merry Christmas.

1012
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,880
So... The deal?

1013

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,720
Break a confession from him
and I go free, right?

1014
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,160
I'm the expert,
you needed me.

1015
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,480
That's one
for the Home Office.

1016
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,080
We'll make good on the offer.
You're free to go, Mr Trent.

[woman] With some caveats.

1019
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,640
- Caveats?

- You'll be on the register.

1020
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,320
What register?

1021
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,560
The one
for Peeping Tom pervs.

1022
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,360
All I did was help some lonely
guys by providing a service.

1023
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,640
An illegal service.

1024
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,960
You also failed
to report a murder,

1025
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,640
fatal poisoning,
in case you've forgotten.

1026
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,080
Kept that information from your
Cookie Monster mate, didn't you?

1027
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,400
What does it mean,
this register?

1039
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,440
There's a proper sentence. Or do
you want me to switch him off?

1040
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,560
No. Leave him
