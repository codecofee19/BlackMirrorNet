BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 1.

EXT. SHORELINE - NIGHT 1

It's 1987. Coastal California. Silhouetted mountains, moonlit
sea. Lights twinkling near the shoreline.

We move closer to see the lights of the town of San Junipero.
Streetlights. Nightclubs and bars. Cars drifting up and down
the main street.

The vehicles date from 1987. There's a billboard advertising
the movie The Witches of Eastwick.

We move closer:

EXT. BARKER STREET - CONTINUOUS 2
This is San Junipero's main drag.

Along the sidewalk we follow YORKIE, a slightly awkward woman
in her early 20s, dressed so as not to stand out. Jeans.
Sweatshirt. She wears glasses with black rims.

She's looking around, a little like a tourist, taking in the
sights. There's a TV in a store window, showing a news

report. The sound is inaudible, but the anchor introduces a
clip of Ronald Reagan giving a speech about the Berlin Wall.

Yorkie looks at this for a moment until her attention is
snatched away by a voice, a young male voice.

WES
Kelly, c'mon...

Yorkie looks round. There's a couple striding along the
sidewalk. At least they look like a couple. The young man is
called WES -- he's conventionally dressed, in a baseball
jacket. The woman looks individual, almost arty. Intriguing.
Attractive. This is KELLY. She's walking a step ahead of Wes,
looking straight ahead, while he buzzes around her.

WES (CONT'D)
Kelly--

KELLY
I'm still walking Wes.

WES
We only got a couple of hours, you
know, so let's use it-

KELLY
I am using it.

They walk through the door of a large bar / music venue
called TUCKER'S.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 2.

Yorkie looks up at the sign for the bar. Then at the door.
Gingerly, she pushes it open.

INT. TUCKER'S - CONTINUOUS 3

This place is a cavern. There's music playing on a sound
system somewhere. C'est La Vie by Robbie Nevil or equiv.

Yorkie looks around. No sign of Kelly or Wes. It's bustling

in here. Everyone dressed in the fashions of the day; a real
mix of archetypes. Everything from preppy kids to prototype

goths. It's like the cast of every John Hughes movie blended
together.

Yorkie is a bit overwhelmed. She walks to a corner containing
a number of video arcade machines.

There's Rolling Thunder. Top Speed. Double Dragon.

Yorkie is drawn to Bubble Bobble, a platform game in which
the players control cartoon dragons that squirt bubbles.

She reaches into her pocket and seems almost surprised to
find some quarters in there. She drops one in the slot and
hits the 1 Player button.
We close in on the game screen. Catchy 8-bit music pipes up.
Black starlit backdrop. Two cartoon dragons and a whirlwind
of bubbles. And the following poorly-translated message:
NOW, IT IS BEGINNING OF A
FANTASTIC STORY!! LET'S MAKE A
JOURNEY TO THE CAVE OF MONSTERS!
GOOD LUCK!

The game begins. Yorkie seems to know what she's doing.

INT. TUCKER'S - LATER 4

Shortly afterwards, a young guy called DAVIS spots Yorkie on
the Bubble Bobble machine. He's faintly nerdy. A bit like a
young Rick Moranis. He's holding a drink with a straw which
he seems ill-at-ease with. He's nodding his head in time to
the music, badly.

Moments later, he's standing beside her, watching her
progress over her shoulder. It takes him a while to pluck up
the courage to speak.

DAVIS
You're good at this.

Yorkie doesn't look up.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

YORKIE
Thanks. I've played it before.

Davis is thinking of something to say.
DAVIS
It's got different endings
depending on if you're in one or
two player.

She's focussing on the game.

YORKIE
Uh-huh?

DAVIS
Kind of the first game to do that.

Yorkie's just lost her last life.

YORKIE
Dammit.

Davis tries to interest her in the Top Speed cabinet.

DAVIS
(holding a quarter)
Oh. Do you want (to try) --?

Yorkie looks at the game. The racing game, depicts a red car
thundering along a highway. The vehicle spins out of control
in a shower of dust.

Yorkie stares at that for a moment -- it disturbs her. Then:
YORKIE
Uh, no -- thank you -- sorry it's

not you. I'm sort of...
(she gestures around)
Just want to get my bearings.

DAVIS
Uh okay. See you around.

Yorkie wanders off. Davis watches her leave, then drops a
quarter in Bubble Bobble.

INT. TUCKER'S - BOOTH SEATING AREA - MOMENTS LATER 5
Yorkie now has a drink -- a Coke in a glass -- and is
wandering deeper into the bar, looking around. Heart and Soul
by T’Pau is playing.

She sits down at a table to people-watch.

Sipping her Coke, she checks out the comings-—and-goings.
Young couples. Preening jocks. Cool kids.

3.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 4A.

Suddenly Kelly walks past. She spots something in the
distance, rolls her eyes a little, and abruptly sits down
beside Yorkie. Yorkie looks at her, a little surprised.

KELLY
(quietly)
Go along with whatever I say.

YORKIE
Sorry?

KELLY
Whatever I say, go along with it.

Just then, WES appears, nearby. He opens his mouth to speak.

KELLY (CONT'D)
(to WES)
Okay, Wes? You're just pestering
now. Do I have to red light you?

WES
(checking watch)
Two hours thirty-five -- there's
not much time left.
KELLY
Wes —--
WES

Last week, we had the most amazing--

KELLY
(cutting him off)
Last week was last week.
(indicating Yorkie)
I need to talk to my friend here,
okay? Haven't seen her in a while.

Kelly puts a supportive arm round Yorkie. Yorkie is surprised
but puts on a smile for Wes.

Wes goes to speak but Kelly interrupts--

KELLY (CONT'D)
Wes, she's sick. Like six months to
live sick.

YORKIE
Five, actually.

Kelly looks at Yorkie, amused and impressed -- but then
immediately having to hide this. She looks back at Wes.

KELLY
I need to catch up with her.
Private time.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

Wes looks, considers protesting, then thinks better of it.

WES

Okay. Okay.
(to Yorkie)
Hey I'm sorry.

YORKIE
That's okay.

WES
(to Kelly)
I'll see you around.

KELLY
Sure.

The girls watch him leave.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Sorry for killing you. The whole
six months to live thing. Sorry --
five. Five was a nice touch.
(she holds her hand out)

Kelly.
YORKIE
Yorkie
KELLY
“Yurgi”?
YORKIE
(slightly louder)
Yorkie
KELLY
Like the dog breed?
YORKIE
(shy laugh)

Yeah.
Kelly thumbs in the direction of Wes.
KELLY
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda
bad. Met him at the Quagmire, so...

YORKIE
What's a Quagmire?

Kelly looks at her. She decides Yorkie looks a little
innocent.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

KELLY
If you don't already know what the
Quagmire is, you probably don't
want to know.
Kelly looks at Yorkie's empty glass.

KELLY (CONT'D)
You want another one?

YORKIE
Uh, I'm not sure --

KELLY
Yeah you do. Come on.

She stands up, beckons Yorkie to follow.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Do I have to tug your leash?

Yorkie smiles.

INT. TUCKER'S - BAR - LATER

A few moments later, the girls are at the bar, on bar stools.
Kelly leans forward to get the attention of the barman, who

has blonde hair. Waik Like An Egyptian is playing.

KELLY
(to barman)
Hey. Blondie?

Mock-offended, the barman points to himself.

BARMAN
I'm "blondie"?

KELLY
You are. Jack and Coke, times two.

YORKIE
Oh no. Mine was just Coke.

KELLY
(ignoring that, to barman)
Times two.

Blondie starts fixing the drinks. Kelly turns to Yorkie,
looks at her slightly strangely.

YORKIE
What are you doing?

KELLY
I'm ‘regarding’ you.

and
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 7.

YORKIE
Feel like I'm being... analysed.

KELLY
Shhh.
(she's reached a
conclusion)
Why the glasses?

Self-consciously, Yorkie touches her glasses.

KELLY (CONT'D)
I mean I like them, they totally
work on you, but do you need them?
I mean do you --

YORKIE
Yeah the lenses don't do anything.

KELLY
Knew it.

YORKIE
I wore glasses back in school but I
guess now they’re kind of a comfort

thing --
KELLY
Old times' sake.
(beat)

I'd figured they were kind of a
fashion statement --

YORKIE
Really?

KELLY
- but then the rest of your outfit
is... Not.

Yorkie looks down at her clothes, a tad self-conscious.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Don't take that wrong. It’s
refreshing. I mean look around.
People try so hard to look how they
think they should look.

The clientele do look like they're trying too hard.
KELLY (CONT'D)
Looks they probably saw in some

movie.

Kelly lightly touches Yorkie's glasses.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 8.

KELLY (CONT'D)
But I like these. They’re
authentically you.

Yorkie is shy.

YORKIE
To be honest I think I wear them
for something to hide behind.

KELLY
(dry)
Something transparent to hide
behind. Okay.

Just then Blondie puts the drinks on the bar.

KELLY (CONT'D)
(to Blondie)
Thanks.
(to Yorkie)
Cheers.

Yorkie clinks glasses and takes a sip. The taste of the Jack
Daniel's makes her cough a little.

YORKIE
(coughing)
That's --
KELLY

(incredulous)
Never tasted it before?

Yorkie doesn't answer at first. Sips more, a bit embarrassed.

YORKIE
No. I just-- haven't had it ina
while. It's good.

Kelly is ‘regarding' her again.

KELLY
Do you live here?

YORKIE
No, but --

KELLY
A tourist?

Yorkie waves her head as though to say "kind of yes, kind of
no", uncertain how to answer.

KELLY (CONT'D)
We'll go with tourist. So you're
new here?
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 9.

YORKIE
First night.

KELLY
First night! Well okay.

She clinks her glass against Yorkie's.

The music changes. The opening of What Have You Done For Me
Lately by Janet Jackson (or equiv). Kelly laughs and claps.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Oh my God! Ha!
(laughing)

We HAVE to dance to this.

She takes a huge gulp of her drink.

YORKIE
With each other?

KELLY
Uh huh.

Yorkie glances at the dance floor. People uninhibited,
laughing, enjoying themselves. Then she looks back at Kelly.

YORKIE
Dance floors are not ‘me’.

KELLY
Ah let’s not limit ourselves...

She takes Yorkie's hand and starts to lead her toward the
dance floor. Yorkie pulls back, hesitant.

YORKIE
I can’t-—

KELLY
My ass you can’t, c’mon--

YORKIE
I'll look dumb and-

KELLY
Just follow my lead.

And she leads Yorkie toward the dance floor.

INT. TUCKER'S - DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER 7

The chorus of the track is in full swing. Kelly dances --
carefree. Yorkie is quite awkward. Almost just standing,
watching. She looks around, trying to vaguely move her
shoulders in time but it's painful to watch. Kelly leans in.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 10.

KELLY
(raised voice over music)
Copy me!

She starts to perform a dance move, pretty much lifted from
Janet Jackson -- nothing too elaborate -- indicating Yorkie
should copy her.

Yorkie starts to follow suit. She’s getting better. Kelly
laughs and nods.

KELLY (CONT'D)
You got it!

Yorkie starts to smile. Hesitancy giving way to enjoyment.
Kelly shows her another move - she copies it -- and another.
It's almost like Simon Says.

Then Kelly ups her game, performs a more flamboyant, somewhat
provocative, writhing move.

Other people on the dance floor start to notice. They’re
enjoying the scene -- not in a malicious or mocking way --
but laughing appreciatively.

Yorkie can't match that. She glances around, self-conscious.
Kelly is oblivious. For a moment we hold on Yorkie as she
watches Kelly lost in the moment, enjoying the attention of
the other dancers.

Yorkie, a little sadly, backs away, then leaves.

Kelly doesn't notice at first. Then she looks around just in
time to see Yorkie leaving.

EXT. TUCKER'S - ALLEYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 8

Yorkie opens a fire door and exits the building - to discover
it's raining. She stays beneath the awning. Kelly emerges.

KELLY
Hey. Why'd you run away?

YORKIE
Sorry -- I said I’m not much of a
dancer.

KELLY

No shit. Like a frightened horse on
a frozen lake back there.

Yorkie goes to walk off.

KELLY (CONT'D)
I'm kidding.

Yorkie turns to look at her, an eyebrow raised.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 11.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Half kidding.
(beat)
Sorry I pushed you into it.
Saturday night's once a week, it's
like no time, I get impatient.

Yorkie sits down on a low wall (or equiv), with a sigh.

YORKIE
It’s not that; everyone was
looking.
KELLY
Looking-?
YORKIE
(indicating the two of

them)
You know? Two girls, dancing.

KELLY
Okay: one, folks are way less
uptight than they used to be, and
two, this is a party town, no-one’s
judging.

Kelly looks down at herself, at her own body. Does a slightly
ridiculous ‘sexy’ move.

KELLY (CONT’D)
Face it, if they were staring it’s
because I. Am. Bodacious.

That makes Yorkie laugh a little.

YORKIE
You're stupid.

KELLY
Thank you.

Yorkie looks up at the night sky.

YORKIE
I've never been on a dance floor
before.

KELLY

Never? As in whole time you've been
alive, never?

YORKIE
Never.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 12.

KELLY
What are you, like, Amish? That's
one sheltered existence you got
there.

Yorkie shrugs.

YORKIE
As far as my family's concerned I
can't do anything.

Kelly sits down beside Yorkie.

KELLY
Yeah. Well. No-one knows about even
half the shit I get up to.
(beat)
With your folks, it's from a place
of love, though right? They worry.

YORKIE
They don't worry. Just the concept
of me enjoying myself... That would

blowwww their minds.

Kelly looks at Yorkie for a moment. Yorkie is kicking her
legs against the wall, absentmindedly. Kelly looks at her
legs.

KELLY
What would you like to do? That
you've never done?

She sidles in, a little closer. Yorkie smiles, a little
excited, a little shy.

YORKIE
Uh...
(looking up)
Oh so many things.

KELLY
San Junipero's a party town. All up
for grabs.
(beat)
Midnight's two hours away.

Kelly's inched in a little more. Yorkie is almost shaking
now, with nerves and excitement.

YORKIE
That's not long.

Kelly brushes some hair away from Yorkie's neck. Then leans
in and talks quietly, almost in her ear.

KELLY
Why waste time sitting here?
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 13.

She puts her hand on Yorkie's inner thigh. Yorkie exhales, as
if with vertigo.

Then she abruptly stands up, very flustered.

YORKIE
I - uh -—- I -- listen --

Kelly isn't offended, immediately takes it with good grace.

KELLY
It's okay.

YORKIE
No, I mean --
(hand over eyes)
Dammit
(eyes open again -- trying
to get words out)
Look, I -- ah -- you seem --

KELLY
Really, it's okay.

YORKIE
(babbling)
I'm engaged. I have a fiancé.

KELLY
At your age?

YORKIE
Yes. I know. Yes.

Kelly is almost amused by Yorkie's embarrassed flustering

YORKIE (CONT'D)
He's a good guy. He's a nice guy.

KELLY
Good guy nice guy--

YORKIE
He is a good guy

KELLY
Rootin' tootin' straight up guy--

YORKIE
Greg, he's called Greg-

KELLY
And is Greg here?

YORKIE
No he's --
(she indicates "somewhere
else")
BLACK MIRROR "SAN

KELLY
Elsewhere?

YORKIE
Yeah.

KELLY
Uh-huh.
(beat)
You want to go to bed with me? We
could be back at mine like--

She clicks her fingers.

YORKIE
I never did anything like that.

KELLY

(smiling)
All the more reason.

Yorkie agonizes for a moment.

YORKIE
I... You're nice. I can't.

KELLY
(shrug)
Okay.

YORKIE
I can't. I-

Kelly is still good-natured.

KELLY
I get it.

YORKIE
I have to go.

KELLY

(indicating the rain)

In this?

YORKIE

It's been great to meet you.

JUNIPERO"

She holds out her hand. To shake hands. Kelly looks at her

hand, amused. Then shakes it.

KELLY
Likewise.

Then Yorkie turns and starts to walk away, quickly. Kelly

watches her leave for a moment, still slightly

amused.

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 15.
We follow with Yorkie for a few moments, tight on her face,
as she strides away, through the rain, murmuring to herself.
YORKIE
(to self)
Okay. Okay. Okay. Shit. Shit.

She stops. She looks up at the sky again. Closes her eyes.
Exhales. Opens her eyes again. Makes a decision.

She turns on her heel to look at Kelly. But she's not there.
Yorkie just catches a glimpse of Kelly walking back in
through the fire escape, the door closing behind her.

Yorkie hovers for a moment, then decides not to follow.

She turns around again and walks away, a little crushed.

EXT. SAN JUNIPERO - NIGHT 9

We see the moon hovering in the sky. Perfect circle.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 10
CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER

Golden hour. Amber light cast on mountains in the background
as the sun bows behind the ocean.

In a low-rise apartment block, a light is on. We close in
slightly.
INT. YORKIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 11

The room is small and sparsely decorated. Panic by The Smiths
is playing on a small tape deck.

Yorkie stands in front of a full length mirror, wearing
similar dowdy gear to last week. She’s looking at herself.
She takes off her glasses.

Next she’s trying on a dress. Magenta, figure-hugging. A
little like Whitney Houston in the video for I Wanna Dance
With Somebody.

She looks at herself and wrinkles her nose. It's not her.

A quick cut and she's trying another look. A pink dress, her
hair tied back. Not dissimilar to Ally Sheedy's makeover in
The Breakfast Club.

Again, she decides against it.

Next she's in the bathroom, looking closely into a cabinet
mirror at her face.
12

13

14

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 16.

Her hair is slicked back, her face is now heavily made-up --
reminiscent perhaps of the 'band of supermodels' in Robert
Palmer's Addicted to Love video.

She looks at her face. It's not her.

YORKIE
No.

Finally she tries something else. A bit more confident, a bit
more glam than before, but still "her". She puts on her
glasses.

EXT. KELLY'S PLACE - EARLY EVENING 12
Meanwhile, elsewhere, Kelly is leaving a house -- a kind of
clapboard beach house -- and walking towards her car, a red
Jeep.

She climbs in, revs the engine.
Sign O' The Times starts playing on the stereo.

She reverses out of the driveway and goes to drive forward,
but suddenly Wes is there, in the road.

She pulls a face. Not entirely unkind, but unimpressed and
impatient. She guns the engine and drives around him.

I/E. KELLY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - SUNSET 13
Kelly's car roars along the highway, Prince at full volume.
She taps the steering wheel in time.

EXT. TUCKER'S - REAR CAR LOT - LATER 14
Now it’s getting dark. Kelly's jeep rolls into the car lot
and pulls to a halt. She climbs out, locks the door, turns

around -- and there's Wes.

KELLY
What the hell, Wes?

She starts to head for the bar. Wes follows.

WES
Look, okay, I know--

KELLY
I'm red-lighting you. For real,
okay?

WES

No! Don't.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN

KELLY
Then stop this.

WES
Just hear me out.

Kelly stops. This is no fun now.

KELLY
How many girls you think there are
in San Junipero? Hundreds?
Thousands?

WES
I don't care --

KELLY
I'm saying there's plenty of other
girls for you Wes. Ones you could
actually settle down with.

JUNIPERO" 17.

WES
The locals, they're like dead
people--
Just then a nearby party-going group walk past -- a woman,
whoops.
KELLY

A little lively for dead people-

WES
I don't want some boring romance
like, Jesus, put us in the
retirement home, deal--

KELLY
(interrupting)
Well if you just want someone to
fuck, there's options, hang out at
The Quagmire again --

WES
It's not just sex--

KELLY
It was just sex--

WES
We made a connection--

KELLY
Wes? Truly: it was just sex.

Wes is a little wounded.

WES
But. No...
15

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 18.

Kelly takes his hand.

KELLY
I'm done with attachments. I went
down that road. For a long time.
And it's -- I can't do that again.
No roots.

She puts a hand on his cheek.

KELLY (CONT'D)
We had fun. I'm sorry.
(beat)
Enjoy the town for God's sake.

Wes nods. He knows he's beaten. Kelly heads for the bar.

INT. TUCKER'S - BAR - LATER 15
Living in a Box by Living in a Box is playing.

Kelly is at the bar. A dude called HARVEY, who looks like
he’s trying to emulate Miami Vice era Don Johnson but not
quite nailing it, sidles over to her. She looks up.

HARVEY
Hey.

Kelly's not too interested. But she’s polite.

KELLY
Hey.

HARVEY
Waiting for someone?

KELLY
Not really.

Harvey sits beside her.

HARVEY
Get you a drink?

KELLY
Sure.

A small distance away, we find YORKIE, dressed in her regular
attire, watching Kelly, plucking up the courage to approach.
From Yorkie’s perspective, Kelly is listening to Harvey. When
we're closer up, we can see Kelly is a tad bored. Harvey’s
saying stuff like:

HARVEY
--.- SO it was micro-surgery I
guess, I mean both my kneecaps were
just kinda worn down...
16

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 19.
Back to Yorkie. She seems to be exhaling, calming herself,
mentally counting down.
Then she starts walking over.
Meanwhile, Harvey has noticed the chorus to Living in a Box.

HARVEY (CONT'D)
Never got this song; kinda weird.

Kelly looks around and spots Yorkie. She smiles and holds her
arm out to Harvey.

KELLY
Shall we dance?

HARVEY
Uh, sure --

She leads him toward the dance floor. Yorkie stops walking
and watches. As they approach the dance floor, Need You
Tonight by INXS comes on.

Kelly dances to the chorus. Aware she’s being watched.

Yorkie watches, wanting to walk over, and failing.

INT. TUCKER'S - BOOTH AREA - LATER 16
Kelly sits in a booth with Harvey, while he talks sports.
Yorkie sits alone at a table across the way, with a drink.
The jukebox is playing Club Nouveau's cover of Lean On Me.

Yorkie glances over at Kelly. Kelly is looking at the table.
Yorkie looks back at her drink.

Then back at Kelly. This time Kelly is looking at her.
Sipping on a straw.

Flustered, Yorkie looks back down. Kelly smiles faintly.
She leans in to Harvey, interrupting him.

HARVEY
--.- I mean I guess if at the time
I'd put that money into, like
computing, caught that first wave,
woulda been a different story -

KELLY
Gotta use the bathroom.

She stands up and walks toward the ladies restroom.
17

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 20.
Across the way, Yorkie watches her go. Kelly glances at her
as she leaves.

Yorkie gets up.

INT. TUCKER'S - LADIES RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER 17
There's no-one else here. Kelly is standing in front of the
mirror checking her hair. Yorkie enters. She stands beside
her. Just stands there for a moment.

No-one says anything.

Then:

YORKIE
I don't know how to do this.

Kelly is still looking in the mirror. Mock innocent:

KELLY
Do what?

YORKIE
Just help me. Can you just --

Kelly looks at her.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Can you make this easy for me?

Kelly touches her face.

KELLY
You want to get in my car?

Yorkie, looking at the floor, nods.
KELLY (CONT'D)
Then let's do that.
EXT. TUCKER'S - REAR CAR LOT - MOMENTS LATER 18
Kelly leads Yorkie out via the fire escape. Walks to the car.
She opens the passenger door. Yorkie hesitates, staring at
the car a moment.
KELLY
I got to lift you up and put you
in?

Yorkie gets in.
19

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 21.

I/E. KELLY'S CAR - FREEWAY - LATER 19

Kelly is racing, at speed, down the freeway. A coastal road.
Yorkie winces slightly as they skid around a bend.

KELLY
(voice raised over the
engine)
Relax. What's the worst that's
gonna happen?

Yorkie looks out of the window. Then back at Kelly.

YORKIE
How long have you been here?

KELLY
Sorry?

YORKIE
(raised voice)
How long you been here?

KELLY
In San Junipero?

YORKIE
Yeah.

KELLY

Ah...

(thinking)
Couple months.

(beat)
Plan is: long enough to enjoy
myself.

(she looks at Yorkie)
Guess I'm a tourist like you.

Yorkie looks out the window again.

YORKIE
Yeah.

She looks a little troubled. Kelly can't see this. But after
a few beats she notices Yorkie is facing the other way.

KELLY
Hey.

Nothing.

KELLY (CONT'D)
You okay?

YORKIE
Yeah.
20

21

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 22.

Yorkie turns around. Kelly is looking straight at her, not
watching the road.

Suddenly Yorkie sees headlights coming straight for them.
Their car has drifted into the oncoming lane.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Shit!

Kelly quickly tugs the wheel, sending the car off the road,
along a dusty bank.

Yorkie looks terrified.
The car skids to a halt.

Kelly looks at Yorkie, who's ruffled, breathing fast.
Suddenly Kelly claps her hands, laughs once.

KELLY
Sorry but --
(laugh)
Man your face.
Yorkie laughs nervously.

Kelly starts the engine again.

EXT. KELLY'S HOUSE - LATER 20

Kelly's jeep is parked outside her home. Kelly and Yorkie are
entering the front door.

INT. KELLY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 21

They walk inside. Yorkie looks around. It’s a nice place.
Yorkie looks around a moment.

YORKIE
Wow.

KELLY
You like it?

Yorkie is looking around.

YORKIE
It’s just so big -

KELLY
Reminds me of where I grew up.

Yorkie spots a small photo of a woman aged around 40 ona
mantelpiece. A photo of a dark-haired woman smiling, beneath
a handmade sign reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALISON.

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 23.

YORKIE
With your mom?

Kelly gently turns Yorkie away from the photo, to face her
instead. Then she starts kissing Yorkie. After a moment's

hesitation, Yorkie reciprocates.

INT. KELLY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

22

It's dark in here. The two women lay down on the bed, Kelly

leading Yorkie.
Kelly's hand moves to unbutton Yorkie's jeans.

YORKIE
(breathless)
You'll have to show me --

KELLY
Good.

They kiss passionately.

INT. KELLY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

Afterwards, they lie side by side in the darkness,
at the ceiling.

KELLY
You never slept with a woman
before?
(beat; strokes Yorkie's
hair: )
That's not a critique. I mean that
was fucking awesome.

YORKIE
Never with a woman.
(beat)
Never with anyone.
Kelly is astonished.

KELLY
Not anyone? What, in town, or --

YORKIE
No-one nowhere.

She turns, smiling.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Guess you deflowered me.

looking up
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 24.

KELLY
I "deflowered" you?
(laughs)
What is this, Merrie England?

YORKIE
(affectionate)
Shut up!

KELLY
You've had relationships though?

YORKIE
(no)
Uh-uh.

KELLY
Hello, you got a fiancé...

YORKIE
It's - that's - complicated-

KELLY
Yeah I’1l say.

There's a silence. They hold hands.

YORKIE
When did you know? That you liked
women?

KELLY

Uh, I like men too.
(jokey raised fist)
Equal rights!

YORKIE
Okay. But when did you know? Did
you always... know?

Kelly looks at her. She doesn't usually open up to conquests.
But there's something about Yorkie.

KELLY

I was married to a guy. A long time
I was married.

(beat)
I always 'knew', I mean, I would be
attracted to other girls, co-
workers, friends. Some waitress
who'd serve me...

(she laughs at the memory)
There were crushes. My God were
there crushes.

Her face hardens slightly.
24

25

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 25.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Never acted on any of it. Never did
anything. I was in love with him. I
really was in love with him.

This is hard for her.

KELLY (CONT'D)
But he chose not to stick around.

Yorkie slides closer. Strokes Kelly's hair. There are tears
glistening in Kelly's eyes now.

KELLY (CONT'D)
So now it's me. And I'm passing
through. And before I leave I'll
have a good time.
(beat)
I'm just gonna have a good time.

Yorkie leans over and gives her a kiss. Kelly is embarrassed,
possibly even annoyed by the vulnerability she's just
displayed.

She glances at a clock radio by the bed. It's 11:59 PM.

KELLY (CONT’D)
Time's nearly up.

YORKIE
Then let's lie here.

They lie, in the dark, without speaking, for a full fifteen
seconds.

The clock radio hits 12:00 AM and we cut abruptly to black.

EXT. BARKER STREET - NIGHT 24
CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER.

The Witches of Eastwick billboard has been replaced by a
poster promoting Spaceballs.

Yorkie, smiling, passes the store window with the TV in it.
There's a trail for the Max Headroom TV show on it.

She heads for Tucker's.

INT. TUCKER'S - CONTINUOUS 25

Yorkie heads into the bar and looks around. There's no sign
of Kelly.

She explores the arcade section. No sign of her there either
(or DAVIS, come to that).
26

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

She checks out the booth area and the dance floor. Nope.

Finally she sits by the bar, sipping a Coke and looking
around. But Kelly's still not there.

I Wanna Dance With Somebody is playing, loudly.

Eventually she leans to speak to Blondie, the barman. Has to
shout to be heard.

YORKIE
You seen Kelly?

BARMAN
What's that?

YORKIE
Kelly.

BARMAN
Haven't seen her all night.

Yorkie looks around again.

BARMAN (CONT'D)
You tried the Quagmire?

YORKIE
What is the Quagmire?

EXT. SECTION OF ROAD - NIGHT 26

Yorkie stands beside the road, almost the middle of nowhere.
She looks at a napkin in her hand, with a scribbled map on
it, given to her by the barman.

In front of her is a gate, with a dirt track behind it.
Beside it, on a small pole, is a sort of entry buzzer with
the word ‘QUAGMIRE’ where the residential name would be.

She pushes the button.

INTERCOM VOICE
Uh-huh?

YORKIE
Hi -- I’m looking for someone --

INTERCOM VOICE
Good luck with that.

Click. They’ve gone. Yorkie pushes the button again.
INTERCOM VOICE (CONT'D)

(bored)
You want in?

26.
27

28

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 27.

YORKIE
(hesitant)
Yeah.

INTERCOM VOICE
You sure?

YORKIE
Uh, yeah -- I -

There’s a buzz. The gate is unlocked. She opens it and steps
through. In front of her, down the end of the track, in the
distance, she sees The Quagmire.

EXT. THE QUAGMIRE - NIGHT 27

This must be the place. For one thing, it has a big neon sign
that says QUAGMIRE.

The Quagmire looks and sounds hard-core. Like a roadhouse
from an 80s action film mixed with a German techno club.
Harley Davidsons parked outside. You Gotta Fight For Your
Right To Party blaring from within.

Two men are making out in the back of a pickup truck parked
to one side.

Yorkie looks at all this, daunted. What the fuck?

INT. THE QUAGMIRE - MOMENTS LATER 28

Yorkie walks in and almost leaves immediately. The interior
of the club looks like a transgressive music video. There are
people dancing in cages. With snakes.

It’s steamy, transgressive and weird in here. Like walking
into the video for Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

A man with a shaved bald head, wrapped in chains, wearing
nothing but a tight jockstrap, and pulling an absurdly
serious face, dances directly in Yorkie's path, like he
thinks he's a frickin' art installation. She goes to step
round him and he dances in her way.

She steps the other way and he finally relents.

Yorkie looks around, in search of Kelly. This is part pick-up
joint, part fantasy-fulfilment dive bar. People making out in
the corners. Exploring / flaunting their sexuality any way
they can.

Yorkie looks at all this, daunted. What the fuck?

A couple sidle over to Yorkie. A man and a woman, both in
their mid-twenties. Both dressed as sailors.
29

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 28.

MAN
(loud over the music)
Hey.

WOMAN
Wanna have fun?

YORKIE
I'm okay thanks.

She walks away. Now the music is Something Against You by The
Pixies.

It’s claustrophobic. Stuffed corridors. She finds herself
squeezing past more people. The further she ventures in, the
more warren-like it gets. At one point she passes a room in
which some kind of orgy seems to be taking place.

Then another area -- from the doorway, glimpsed over
shoulders, and between arms, she can see there’s some sort of
bare-knuckle fight going on. (NB no blood.)

INT. THE QUAGMIRE - CONTINUOUS 29

Yorkie turns away and almost walks straight into WES, who's
striding past clutching a bottle of beer.

WES
Woah, hey.

YORKIE
sorry.

Their eyes meet.

WES
I know you from somewhere.
(beat)
Tucker's.
(beat)
Kelly's friend, huh?

YORKIE
(nodding)
You know where to find her?

WES
How would I know that?

He starts to walk away.

YORKIE
You're her friend.

WES
Was a friend.
30

31

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 29.

YORKIE
Has she been here?

WES
No.

A beat. He looks at her. A penny drops for him.

WES (CONT'D)
You too, huh? Well --

He drinks his beer in a kind of toast.

Yorkie looks flat. This is no use. She's about to leave when
Wes takes pity on her.

WES (CONT'D)
Try a different time. Seen her in
"80. Mid 90s. '02 one time.
(beat)
She's worth a shot, right?

He raises his bottle again. Yorkie turns toward the exit.

EXT. BARKER STREET - 1980 - EVENING 30
CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER

But on Barker Street, as the evening sun burns amber, earlier
period cars are driving by. They date from 1980.

The billboard now advertises the doomed Village People movie
Can't Stop The Music.

Yorkie, exactly the same age, but dressed subtly differently,
her styling befitting the year 1980, strides past the store
with the TV in the window, which is showing a scene from the
Who Shot J.R? storyline in Dailas.

She heads purposefully for Tucker's.

INT. TUCKER'S - CONTINUOUS 31

Funkytown by Lipps Inc pounds from the speakers as Yorkie
looks around. Everyone is dressed in the styles and fashions
of 1980.

But there's no sign of Kelly.

She walks past the arcade section, which features Pac Man,
Rally-X and Missile Command.

And there's DAVIS, the games nerd. He's styled like a young
Bill Gates, and has just completed a game of Battlezone when
he spots Yorkie.
32

33

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

DAVIS
Hey.

Yorkie recognizes him.

YORKIE
Oh, hey.

Davis indicates the Pac Man cabinet.

DAVIS
Golden age, right?

YORKIE
Right.

She's still looking around.

DAVIS
You playing, or..?

YORKIE
Sorry. Looking for someone.

Davis nods.

DAVIS
Maybe next time?

There's a brief cut to black. Then:

EXT. BARKER STREET - 1996 - NIGHT 32
CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER

The billboard? Independence Day.

A '96 Ford Contour slides by.

Yorkie -- again, the same age, but now styled almost like a
slacker - walks past the store, which now has a Sony
Trinitron in the window, relaying a news story about the
Atlanta Olympics.

Yorkie looks up at the Tuckers sign. Which has changed. It
looks more... 90s.

INT. TUCKERS - CONTINUOUS 33
Full screen, we see part of the intro to the Namco arcade
game TIME CRISIS, which looks like an early Playstation
attempt to recreate the movie Die Hard. We pull out just as

Yorkie walks past.

Deeper into the bar, the music system is playing Killing Me
Softly by The Fugees.

30.
34

35

36

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 31.

In almost a shot for shot repeat of a scene we saw moments
ago, Yorkie seeks Kelly in the club. Everyone's dressed and
styled ala 1996.

Again she looks. Again no sign.

Yorkie sighs. No dice.

EXT. KELLY’S HOUSE - LATER 34
Yorkie is standing outside Kelly’s house. The lights are off.
She looks through the window -- nothing.

Checks the door.

Stands back at a distance and calls up at the upper windows:

YORKIE
Kelly!

Then louder.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Kelly!

But nothing.

EXT. BARKER STREET - 2002 - SUNSET 35
CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER

There's a billboard for The Bourne Identity.

A Chrysler PT Cruiser thrums past.

Yorkie -- styled for the era -- passes a shop window with a
widescreen TV showing footage from 2002.

Into Tuckers she goes.

INT. TUCKERS - CONTINUOUS 36

The music system is blaring Can't Get You Out of My Head by
Kylie Minogue. (or Hot in Herrre by Nelly)

Yorkie scans the bar, the booths, the dance floor -- nothing.

She's walking out, past the arcade section, past a Namco
Dance Dance Revolution 7th Mix machine -- one of those huge
two-player ‘dancing games' where you step on pads on the
floor to progress - when she suddenly stops.

Kelly's dancing on it. With Davis. Whose geeky look suddenly
seems quite chic.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 32.

Yorkie walks over to watch as they dance to some hi-energy
Japanese pop.

Kelly's doing well, as is Davis.

As the music comes to an end -- they're both awarded a GREAT!
ranking. Kelly high-fives Davis, and looks around.

She locks eyes with Yorkie. Looks unsure of herself for a
moment. Her smile drops. Then she turns to Davis.

KELLY
Excuse me. Ladies' room.

She starts to head off. Yorkie is in hot pursuit.
By the restroom, she catches up with her.

YORKIE
No. You wait a minute.

KELLY
(irritated)
Why are you here?

YORKIE
I was looking for you. Where did
you go?

KELLY

Felt like a change of music.

She starts fiddling with a Nokia 7650. Yorkie immediately
snatches it from her and throws it across the room.

YORKIE
How the hell is this your era?

KELLY
(pointing after phone)
I was looking at that.

YORKIE
You hid from me.

KELLY
1) I did not, 2) I owe you zero and
3) see point 2.

She storms into the ladies restroom.

37 INT. TUCKERS - LADIES RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS 37

Yorkie is right on Kelly's heels.
38

39

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 33.

YORKIE
It's not about who owes who, it's
about manners.

KELLY
Hah!

YORKIE
You don't know who I am. You don't
know what this means.

KELLY
(indicating "the world")
This means fun. Or it should do.
(indicating "you and me")

And this. This is not fun. Okay.
This is not fun.

Yorkie stops fighting. Her eyes are wet.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Okay. Look. Don't (do that).

YORKIE
So you don't feel bad?

Kelly doesn't know what to say.
YORKIE (CONT'D)

Maybe you should feel bad. Or at

least feel something.
She turns and leaves. Kelly sighs.
Turns and looks at herself in the mirror.
Then she punches the mirror, hard. It splinters. Shatters.
Kelly looks down at her hand. No blood.
She looks at her reflection in the mirror, which is now
unharmed.
EXT. TUCKERS - ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER 38
The fire door is flung open as Yorkie stomps out. She paces
in a circle for a moment, upset and uncertain, not knowing
what to do.
She spots the fire escape, snaking up the side of the
building.
EXT. TUCKERS - FRONT - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS 39

Shortly afterwards, Kelly emerges from Tuckers, looking for
Yorkie. She looks around and can't see anything.
40

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 34.

KELLY
Yorkie?

She starts heading for the main street to see if she can find
her. All she can see is a couple, sitting on the hood of a
car, looking up at something high up, behind her. She paces
over to them.

KELLY (CONT'D)
You seen a girl, mid-twenties,
brown hair, glasses?

The girl half of the couple just points up and behind Kelly.

Kelly turns. Standing on the roof of Tuckers, on the very
edge, is Yorkie, looking down at the sidewalk.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Aw jeez.

As Kelly turns to head for the fire escape, the GIRL turns to
the GUY.

GIRL
Why's she up there anyhow?

He shrugs a little.

GUY
Newbie testing the boundaries.
Dumbasses pull that shit a lot.
(he nudges her)
Not that I'm against tourists.

The girl giggles.

EXT. TUCKERS - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER 40

Kelly clambers off the top of the fire escape. Yorkie is
sitting on the edge now, calmly, legs dangling over the side.

Kelly makes her way towards her.
KELLY

Please tell me you got your pain
slider set to zero.

Yorkie continues to stare out at San Junipero.

YORKIE
Think so.

Kelly takes off her heels and sits down beside her.

KELLY
Okay, listen --
41

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 35.

Yorkie cuts her off. Points down at the sidewalk, the people.

YORKIE
How many of them are dead? Like
what percentage?

KELLY
As in full timers?
(shrug)
Eighty. Eighty-five.

Yorkie nods.

She takes

KELLY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry.

YORKIE
I'm not gonna jump--

KELLY
I know, I'm sorry whatever. It's --
in the time I've been here --

(sigh)
I'm just visiting, you know? And
it's -- I didn't want to... I said
I wouldn't -- I don't know --
'do'... feelings...

(beat)

You freaked me out.
Yorkie's hand.

KELLY (CONT'D)

I don't want to 'like' anyone. So
you've been...

(laughs gently)
-.. just totally fucking
inconvenient.

(beat; squeezes her hand

harder)

Is that -- I mean --

Kelly is getting emotional now.

KELLY (CONT'D)
I don't know how long there is, and
I can't -- I -- I wasn't prepared
for this, for you, for wanting
something so--

Abruptly Yorkie turns to her, and they kiss passionately.

INT. KELLY'S PLACE - BEDROOM / BALCONY - LATER 4l

Clock reads 11:55 PM. The decor in Kelly's room is slightly
different. 2002 style. There's a poster for the Salt Lake
City Winter Olympics on the wall.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 36.

The bed is in disarray. We move toward the balcony.

On the balcony, the women stand, Yorkie wrapped in a bed
sheet, Kelly in just a man's white shirt. Hair ruffled. San
Junipero in the distance. Kelly leaning over the side,
smoking a cigarette. Yorkie breaks the silence.

YORKIE
Can't believe I'm getting married
next week.

KELLY
Next week? To 'nice' Greg. Sure
you're going through with that?

YORKIE
I have to.

KELLY
You have to?

Yorkie thinks for a moment.

YORKIE
He really is a good guy. I mean my
family don't approve but they can't
stop us.
(beat)
I know he pities me, that pisses me
off, and that's not fair...

Kelly kisses her cheek.

KELLY
Shhh.

Yorkie thinks for a moment.

YORKIE
You said you didn't know how long
there is. Back on the roof. "I
don't know how long there is". What
was that?

Kelly tenses up a little. Leans back and exhales.

KELLY
They tell me three months. It's
spread basically everywhere.
(beat)
They've said three months before,
six months ago, so y'know, what do
they know?

She looks at the cigarette in her fingers.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Doesn’t even taste of anything.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

She flicks it over the edge. There's a silence. Yorkie
strokes Kelly's hair.

YORKIE
So -- you're gonna stay here? Pass
over, go full time?

Kelly shakes her head.

KELLY
No. When I'm done, I am done.

YORKIE
But that's -- I mean why --?
KELLY
Richard -- that's -- my husband's
name was Richard -- he died just

two years ago. So he had the
opportunity to stay in San
Junipero, pass over. Didn't take
it. Didn't want to take it.

YORKIE
Why wouldn't anyone take it?

KELLY
He -- we both -- he had his
viewpoint. There were things he
believed, and things he didn't
believe in, and this place was one
of them. Wouldn't even visit, take
the trial run.

YORKIE
Shit, I wasn't sure I wanted to try
it out, but -- like without this
place I'd never have met someone
like you --

KELLY
Yeah you could have --

YORKIE
I wouldn't --

KELLY
We could've met outside all this--

YORKIE
You would not have got me at all.
At all.

If you really met me, I mean if you
REALLY met me, you wouldn't like me-

So come on, I “showed you mine”.
Where are you?

I can just look it up--

Santa Rosa. CA.

KELLY
That's no distance--

It's, what, 200 miles--

KELLY
I like to travel. When they let me,
which is not often.

So they won't let you anyway and--

KELLY
Oh I'11 make them let me-

Yorkie hardens.

YORKIE
I don't want you to. I don't want
you to see me.

Yorkie stares at her. Slowly, almost imperceptibly nods.

In the bedroom, the clock radio clicks from 11:59 to 12:00.

EXT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - DAY 42

Outside a care home for seniors, a frail woman in her early
70s is being helped into a slightly futuristic-—looking
vehicle by a kindly young nurse named Laura.

LAURA
Okay Kelly... take my hand... Here
you go.

I/E. DRIVERLESS VEHICLE - LATER 43

As the nurse, Laura, sits reading some kind of translucent
tablet, ELDER KELLY (because yes, that's who it is), looks
out of the window, watching the scenery, a faint smile on her
lips.

EXT. ST. BIRINUS HOSPITAL - LATER 44

The vehicle has come to a halt outside a hospital in Santa
Rosa. Laura helps Kelly down the steps of the vehicle. A
doctor in his 30s holds out a hand to greet her.

DOCTOR
You must be Kelly.

ELDER KELLY
I guess I must.

DOCTOR
She's waiting for you.
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - LATER 45

The doctor leads Kelly to a small private room. He opens the
door for her, then waits outside the room.

We follow Kelly as she walks inside.
We can hear the soft beep of a monitoring device.
The percussive rise and fall of a mechanical ventilator.

DOCTOR
She won't be able to physically
respond in any way, but she can
hear you.
(beat)
I'll give you some privacy.
46

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 40.

Kelly looks down. There, lying in bed, is an exceptionally
frail woman in her 60s.

Grey hair, and not much of it. She's in a neck brace. She
can't move. Her eyes are open. Her mouth is frozen in a blank
expression -- neither a smile nor a grimace. She's looking at
Kelly from her fixed position.

Kelly, for a moment, doesn't know quite what to do.

She walks nearer. Takes a seat beside the bed.

She looks at Yorkie.

Takes her hand.

ELDER KELLY
Hi stupid.

She squeezes her hand.

ELDER KELLY (CONT’D)
It's good to see you.

She strokes Yorkie's hair and kisses her on the forehead.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER 46

A little later, Laura is helping Kelly along the corridor
when a kindly, overweight hospital porter named GREG (mid
40s), catches up with them.

GREG
(to KELLY)
Hi -- is it -- Kelly?

ELDER KELLY
It is.

He holds out a hand.

GREG
I'm Greg.

Kelly stares at him for a moment.

ELDER KELLY
You're Greg?
(beat)
Well holy shit.

GREG
You know I think it's great you
came in person before she passes
over; I mean even her folks don't
visit no more so --
47

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 4l.

Kelly is shocked.

ELDER KELLY
She's passing over?

There's a beat. Kelly looks lost in thought. Greg looks at

Laura -- "what do I do?" -- Laura looks back -- "I don't
know".

Finally:

ELDER KELLY (CONT'D)
When?

Greg waves an arm in the direction of the hospital canteen.
GREG
Uh let's go grab a coffee.
INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN AREA - LATER 47
Elder Kelly sits opposite Greg at a small table. They both
have trays in front of them. The detritus of snacks nearby.

Disposable coffee cups.

GREG
She didn't tell you.

ELDER KELLY

No.
(beat)
No she did not.
(beat)
Said she was just visiting.
GREG
More like sampling the trial

version.
Kelly stares down into her coffee. Greg fills the silence.

GREG (CONT'D)
I mean I only known her the past
three years. We talk on the combox.
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic? And how long she's
been that way?

Kelly's face says no, she didn’t.

GREG (CONT'D)
So one night, she's 21 -- comes out
to her folks. They’re a little
‘uptight’ about it you might say.
Tell her they don't want a gay
daughter.

(MORE )
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

GREG (CONT'D)
It’s not natural and so forth. They
fight, she gets in her car, runs it
off the road. Boom.

ELDER KELLY
When she was 21?

GREG
More'n 40 years back. It’s been her
whole lifetime basically.
(beat)
So the whole San Junipero system's
been a big deal for her. The
biggest deal.

He takes a bite of sandwich.

GREG (CONT'D)

The hospital didn't have a
subscription -- some of us held a
crowd-sourcing campaign. Took us a
year but we got the money.

(beat)
Course till she passes over, goes
permanent, she's got the five-hour
weekly limit - but I guess you're
the same.

ELDER KELLY
(nods)
They ration it out. They don’t
trust us with more.

GREG
I mean they say you go crazy if you
have too much. Never leave your
seat, disassociate your body from
your mind...

Kelly is warming up slightly.

ELDER KELLY
Like that doesn't happen in every
senior home already.

(beat)

System's there for therapeutic
reasons, officially, at my place.
"Immersive Nostalgia Therapy".
“Plunge you into a world of
memories”; helps with Alzheimers.
That's what they say.

Greg stops eating for a moment and looks at her.

ELDER KELLY (CONT'D)
That's not my problem incidentally.

He smiles and raises a coffee cup.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 43.

GREG
Small mercies.

Kelly wants to address something.

ELDER KELLY
So. This ‘marriage’..?

Greg finishes his coffee and exhales.

GREG

State's got a triple-lock on
euthanasia cases.

(counting on fingers)
You gotta have sign off from the
doc, the patient, and a family
member. Stops people passing over
just ‘cause they prefer San
Junipero flat out.

Elder Kelly sardonically looks around the dowdy canteen.

ELDER KELLY
Who'd want to leave all this
wonder?

Greg chuckles lightly.

GREG
Heh. Anyhow Yorkie's family? Big
time religious. Don't come fuckin'
see her -- pardon my tongue -- but
they're big time religious. And
they won't sign.

ELDER KELLY
But a spouse can override that.
Hence the wedding bells.

GREG
(nods)
You got it.
(beat)
Got a pastor coming in tomorrow
A.M., she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

ELDER KELLY
"Scheduled to pass'. Let's just
call it dying.

GREG
If you can call it dying.

ELDER KELLY
Uploaded to the cloud. Sounds like
heaven.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN

GREG
I guess.

ELDER KELLY
You gonna wear a suit?

GREG
(laugh, shaking head)
Ceremony's in my coffee break.
(beat)
I never married, so I figured
what's the harm?

Kelly watches him eat for a moment.

ELDER KELLY
You're a good man.

He shrugs.

GREG
Least I could do, right?

Kelly thinks.

ELDER KELLY
You think you could hook us up to
the system, now, just for a little
while, before she passes?

GREG
You can still see her afterwards. I
mean then she's 'no limits', she's
full-fat permanent San Juniperan--

ELDER KELLY
I know, but -- can you?

Greg stops eating.

GREG
We're meant to stick to the five
hour cutoff. Once a week-—-

ELDER KELLY
But you can bend that. They let us
have more on birthdays and
Thanksgiving. Special occasions.

GREG
Seriously, it's so tight they--

ELDER KELLY
Night before her wedding, that's a
special occasion.

Greg thinks.

ELDER KELLY (CONT'D)
I only want a moment.

Greg buckles.

GREG
You brought your...
(gestures)
Connector with you?

ELDER KELLY
(nodding)
I call it a 'bipper'.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - LATER 48

Kelly sits in a chair in the corner of the room, a box about
the size of a paperback book in her hands. She opens it up
and there's a small, extendable device within, something like
a cross between a set of earphones and a stethoscope.

Greg, meanwhile, is affixing an identical device to Yorkie, a
nodule touching her temple, in the bed.

He looks at Laura, the woman who accompanied Kelly here.

GREG
(to LAURA)
Ma'am, watch the door.
(to KELLY)
You got five minutes. No more.

ELDER KELLY
Thank you.

Kelly positions the device in place and touches the button on
a small handheld controller.

A small blue LED embedded in the device nodule starts to
glimmer.

EXT. KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY 49

1987. It's Kelly's San Junipero house, during daylight hours.
She opens the door, and there, looking a little confused, is
Yorkie.

KELLY
Hey. Over here. Hurry!

Yorkie looks round.

YORKIE
Not been here during daylight hours
before.

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 46.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
(beat)
It's warm.

Kelly walks outside to join her. They hold hands and walk
along the sand.

KELLY
So I spoke to Greg.

YORKIE
Uh-huh.

KELLY
You're passing over tomorrow.

YORKIE
Couple hours after the wedding.
(looks around)
So I guess technically I'm
honeymooning here. Forever.
(beat)
I'm sorry I didn't tell y--

Kelly puts a finger to Yorkie's lips.

KELLY
I'm gonna say something crazy.

YORKIE
Okay.

Kelly goes down on one knee. Right there.

KELLY
Wanna marry me instead?

Yorkie looks stunned.

KELLY (CONT’D)

Just -- Greg seems great, but --
why not someone you've... Connected
with...?

Yorkie drops down, and kisses her.
KELLY (CONT'D)
That a yes?
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY 50
A pastor is reading the words of the marriage ceremony, as

Kelly sits beside Yorkie, holding her hand. Greg and Laura
look on.

PASTOR

-..-to be your lawfully wedded wife,

to have and to hold, in sickness

and in health, in good times and

woe, for richer or poorer...
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - LATER 51
An official-looking member of staff holds out a translucent
tablet, with a consent form on it. Using her forefinger,
Kelly taps a consent box [for 'spouse']; her consent is
registered.
The official looks round at a doctor. Gives the nod.

In the bed, Yorkie is hooked up with the 'connector' device.

There's also a new tube attached to her arm. The doctor holds
a syringe. He looks at Kelly.

Kelly, sitting beside Yorkie, is stroking Yorkie's hair. She
nods.

The doctor presses the syringe. An opaque white fluid travels
through the snaking pipe, into Yorkie's arm.

The winking LED on the connector starts to go into overdrive.
Close up on Kelly stroking Yorkie's hand.
A screen indicates her vital signs have finished.

Greg draws a sheet over Yorkie's face.

EXT. BEACH - LATER 52
It's a deserted beach. Daylight hours. A small cove. White
sand. Yorkie, alone, walks along the shore, closing her eyes
and feeling the warmth of the sun.

She picks up a stone and skims it into the water. Feels the
breeze and smiles. Sits down on the beach. Clenches and
unclenches her toes in the sand.

She removes her glasses. Looks at them for a moment and drops
them on the sand.

Looks up and watches the sea and the skies.

EXT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - DAY 53

The vehicle has drawn to a halt. Elder Kelly is being helped
out of the vehicle by Laura.
54

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 48.

INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - KELLY'S ROOM - LATER 54

Elder Kelly, sitting in an armchair, is coughing -- painfully
and deeply.

With Laura's assistance she slips on the connector device and
sits back in her arm chair.

One more cough.

LAURA
You sure you're alright?

Kelly nods, and indicates for Laura to hit the button. She
closes her eyes.

EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - SAN JUNIPERO - NIGHT 55
Yorkie stands by the side of the road, waiting.
Kelly pulls up in her 1987 jeep, I Need Love by LL Cool J on
the stereo. Her car has a bow on the front. She's wearing a
white wedding dress.
Yorkie laughs and claps her hands.
KELLY
You didn't dress up to see me? Come
on...

Suddenly Yorkie is also in a white wedding dress.

YORKIE
Better?

Smiling, Kelly opens the car door. Yorkie climbs in and they
drive off. There are tin cans affixed to the back, bouncing
and sparking off the road.

EXT. UPPER RIDGE - LATER 56

The jeep sits parked in an isolated spot looking down over
San Junipero below. The two women sit side by side on the
hood, looking out at the lights down below. Crickets
chirping.

Yorkie looks up at the moon, and back out at the lights.

YORKIE
Looks so real.

She raps on the hood.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Feels so real.
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO"

She turns round and kisses Kelly. Then jumps off the hood and
starts dancing in the dirt.

KELLY
(laughing)
What are you doing?

YORKIE
I love it! I just --

She does a cartwheel and ends up looking out into the night.
The wind blowing through her hair.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
(quieter)
I love it.

KELLY
You've been here before.

YORKIE
Yeah but now I live here.

She turns to look at Kelly, smiling.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Be with me.

KELLY
I'm with you now.

YORKIE
That's not what I mean.

Kelly tenses up.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Pass over. When you're ready, when
it's your time. Pass over.

KELLY
Yorkie —--

YORKIE
Stay here, with me--

KELLY
Can we just enjoy tonight --

YORKIE
(checking watch)
It's ten to midnight, you're out of
here in ten and we gotta wait a
week to meet again.

KELLY
You know, I'm just a visitor--
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 50.

YORKIE
For how long? Couple months? Then
what?

KELLY

We're not discussing this--

YORKIE
Then you'll be gone, just gone. You
could have forever.

KELLY
Forever, who can even make sense of
forever --

YORKIE

However long you want then, you can
remove yourself like that-—-

(clicks fingers)
It's not a trap, it's -- look at
it.

She gestures around. Then she raps the hood of the car again,
insistently.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
(rapping hood)
Touch it.

Kelly gets off the car, starts heading for the driver's door.

KELLY
I'm going.

Yorkie grabs her arms, turns her around. She takes Kelly's
hands and puts them on her own (Yorkie's) face.

YORKIE
It's real. This is real.
(beat)
And this.

She holds gestures to the wedding ring on her finger,
smiling.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Uh-huh?

KELLY
C'mon, you know that’s a gesture --

YORKIE
You married me--

KELLY
To help you pass over, as a...
kindness --
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 51.

YORKIE
Not so kind to leave.

Kelly breaks off.

YORKIE (CONT'D)
Look, I'm sorry but -- I’ve got
this chance, we got this chance --
I want to share it with you.

Kelly is heading back to the car

KELLY
I said I made my choice.

YORKIE
What is it? What, you feel bad
"cause your husband isn't here?

KELLY
Don’t.

YORKIE
Well that was his choice. He chose
to turn this down-

KELLY
Please--

YORKIE
It's like he left you. I mean he
could've passed over here but, no --
he left you.
That makes Kelly instantly angry. Hard to control it.

KELLY
You don't know what you're saying.

YORKIE
You should be mad at him, not
whipping yourself with guilt--

Yorkie goes to take her hand again.

KELLY
Get off me.

Yorkie tries to pull her back
YORKIE
You can’t see it - what he did, it
was selfish, actually--

Kelly slaps her. Yorkie holds her cheek, shocked.

There's a silence. Then:
BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 52.

KELLY
(angry)
Forty nine years. I was with him
for forty nine years. You can't
begin to imagine -- you can't know -

She's letting it all out.

KELLY (CONT'D)
The bond. The commitment. The
boredom. The yearning. The
laughter. The love of it. The
fucking love. You just cannot know.
Everything we sacrificed. The years
I gave him, the years he gave me.
Did you think to ask? Did it occur
to you to ask?

Yorkie is silenced. Kelly is increasingly emotional, and
angry.

KELLY (CONT’D)
We had a daughter. Alison. Always
difficult, always beautiful. Died
at 39 years old, bless her heart,
and Richard and I, we felt that
heartbreak as one. You think you're
the only person ever suffered, go
fuck yourself.

YORKIE
I didn't know--

KELLY
Didn't think to. Y'know when he was
dying Rich said to me -- when they

offered him this, to pass over,
pass through, serve eternity in
this fucking graveyard you're so in
love with -- he said how can I?
When she missed out, how can I? And
so he went.
(beat)

And I wish I could believe he's
with her now, they're together, but
I don't. I believe they're nowhere.
Like you said, gone. Just gone.

Yorkie goes to embrace her, but Kelly physically pushes her
away.

KELLY (CONT'D)
No. I pitied you and that's the
truth. I pitied you. And now you
give me some sales pitch about how
fuckin' peachy 'forever' could be..
57

BLACK MIRROR "SAN JUNIPERO" 53.

Yorkie moves closer.

YORKIE
I'm sorry--

KELLY

You want to spend forever

somewhere nothing matters? End up
like Wes; all those... lost fucks
at the Quagmire, trying anything
just to feel something? Go ahead.
But I’m out. I’m gone.

She pushes Yorkie aside -- jumps in the car, guns the engine.

YORKIE
Kelly, I'm sorry --

But it's too late. Kelly roars away.

I/E. KELLY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 57
Crying, Kelly roars along the highway at full throttle. The
clock on the dash reads 11:58. She's flying at full speed.
‘Just Married' cans sparking furiously against the tarmac.

She swerves around a corner, narrowly avoiding a set of
headlights. Slams her foot harder on the accelerator.

Up ahead, a section of road gives way to a drop. Before it
are a set of concrete bollards.

Kelly looks at this. Aims the car right for it.
The car thumps into the bollards. Dead stop. Glass fragments
spray around Kelly as she flies through the windshield—like a

rag doll fired from a cannon.

She skids across the tarmac and comes to a halt in the centre
of the road, a broken heap.

She lies still for a moment. All is silent.

Then slowly, she sits up. She's dusty -- but physically
unharmed. She looks up at the night sky. At the moon.

Then a hand reaches down to help her up.

She looks round. It's Yorkie.

Kelly looks at the outstretched hand. Looks up at Yorkie.
The clock on the dash clicks to midnight.

Yorkie stands alone in the middle of the road.

INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - KELLY'S ROOM - CONTINUGIES
Elder Kelly, sitting in a chair, suddenly lurches forward
slightly, as though rousing from a dream. She reaches for the
‘connector’ nodules on her temples and takes them off.

In the corner of the room sits Laura, asleep with an e-book
on her lap.

Elder Kelly rubs her eyes a little. Leans back against her
chair and sighs.
EXT. SAN JUNIPERO - NIGHT 59

Yorkie, alone, is walking along the middle of the road. She
looks up at the sky.

We fade out. Then fade up on:

Time has passed. Bright, burning sunlight glints off the
walls of the Sienna Trust nursing home.

Elder Kelly sits in a main lounge area. An oxygen tank
attached to her nostrils.

At other tables there are seniors playing dominos. Staring at
the walls.

In her room, Elder Kelly is having another coughing fit.
Painful, sharp. It comes to an end. Laura rubs her back.

EXT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - EVENING 63

Elder Kelly sits outside, watching the sun set. She seems at
peace.

ELDER KELLY

Well okay then.

Elder Kelly just looks at her for a moment.

LAURA (CONT'D)

Laura's more confused.

LAURA
For what?

ELDER KELLY
For the rest of it.

And she smiles.

Cut to black. Then:

EXT. TUCKER'S CAR LOT - 1987 - DAY 64

Yorkie climbs into a black Toyota MR2 and drives out of the
car lot. She slides a cassette into the deck and hits play.

It's Belinda Carlisle, Heaven is a Place On Farth.
BELINDA CARLISLE
Ooh baby do you know what that's

worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on Earth.

INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - KELLY'S ROOM - DAY 65

Kelly is lying in bed, a tube delivering clear liquid into

She closes her eyes.
