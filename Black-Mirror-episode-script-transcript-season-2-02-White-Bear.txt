31
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,920

Stay back. Get back! Get back!

32
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59, 640
Get back...back...

33
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,280
Let me in. Let me in...
Help me. Help me!

34
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,920
Shit!

35
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,320
- There's a door round there.
- It's locked.

36
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,600
- You don't know that!
- There's a keypad.

37
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,280
We should try it.

38
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,440
Get down. Anyone stands up,
he'll shoot their heads off.

39
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,320
He's trying to kill me!
What's going...
40
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,040
Shut up!
I'm trying to think.

41
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,480
He can see you.
Get back.

42
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
Oh, my God!
What's wrong with those people?

43
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,760
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

44
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,960
- Where the fuck have you been?
- What?

45
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Get that extinguisher.

46
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
I can't!

I can't do it!

47
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Get it now!

48
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
Ok... Ok... Ok... Ok... Ok...

49
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,040
Come on!

50
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,080
Quickly! Roll it to me!

51
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,640
Damien, if he climbs

through, you grab him and

52
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,680
you grab his gun, if you can.

53
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,280
- I can't!
- You can!

54
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,280
- He'll shoot me!
- You have to!

55
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
I'm gonna smash the lock
off that door.

56
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,560
You help him with Gun Guy.

57
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

58
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
We have to rush him or run, Ok?

59
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,560
- I can't do this!
- We have no choice!

60
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,680
Help him.

61
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,720
(growls)

62
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,720
Damien!

63
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,840

that?

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,480

They like scaring people.
77
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
What?

78
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Okay.

79
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,800
We have to run for that opening.

80
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
They'll see us.

81
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,680
If they're busy with him,
we can lose the hunters. Okay?

82
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
No.

83
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,720
You just stay with me. Okay?

84
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,160
Ready... Come on...

85
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,760
Wait.

86
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Wait.

87
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,240
The onlookers sometimes
wait in the windows.

88
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
Keep a lookout.

89
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm pretty sure that's
how they find us.

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,760
Through the cameras somehow.

91
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,160
Onlookers spot you and a few
minutes later

92
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,720
the scary bastards
turn up.

93
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,320
This is mad, this is just mad.

94
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,880
Look, you have to hold it
together and do what I say

95
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,040
or you'll get us both killed.

96
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,760
I woke up in this house. I don't
even know if it was my house.

97
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,800
I don't even
know who I am.

98
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,840
You must know something.

99
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,280
I think this is my daughter.

100
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
But you don't know?

101
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,760
She could be anywhere.

102
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,280
Maybe you tried to kill
yourself, would that explain it?

103
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,600
There was pills.

104
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,440
I don't blame you.

105
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
Lots have tried that fun fork
in the road since it started.

106
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,680
Since what started?

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,280
You really don't know?

108
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,360
No.

109
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,000
There was a signal, like
pictures, flashing pictures.

110
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

111
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,640
anything with a screen.

112
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,680
I saw it.

113
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,520
I saw it.

114
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

Look out.

115
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,520
They did something to people.

116
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,520
Like almost everybody just
became onlookers:

117
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,040
started watching,
filming stuff,

118
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
like spectators who don't
give a shit about what happens.

119
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,720
That's like nine out
of ten people now.

120
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,400
But not us.

121
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,280
Some of us weren't
affected, I don't know why.

122
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,520
Like that man with the
gun and that woman.

123
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,240
I call them "hunters".

124
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,000
You might've noticed
that's what they do.

125
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,840
They seemed normal to begin
with, but then they realise they
126
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,800
could do what they wanted --
they started taking stuff,

127
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,760
nicking cars 'cause they could,
doing what they like -

128
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,400
and not just with
things, with people.

129
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,240
It got worse and worse.
Now they've got an audience.

130
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,480
So this, this,
this thing on the TV--

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,560
The signal--

132
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
That's, that's
what's doing it.

133
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
That's what's making
them act like this?

134
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
I guess they were always
like that, underneath.

135
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,120
Just needed the rules to change,
for no one to intervene.

136
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,320
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,280
"Do" do nothing; we get out.

138
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,520
Where's "out"?

139
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,880
We're here.

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,560
We need to head south of here.

141
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,560
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's okay there.

142
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,120
The TV transmitters, they
carry it. There's only one

143
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,720
between us and the safe zone
and were gonna knock it out.

144
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,480
See, it's here.
White Bear.

145
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,280
What?

146
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,920
White Bear.

147
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,680
(Little Girl) A picnic
with my two best friends.

Jesus, what is it with you?

150
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,880
White Bear, you
said White Bear.

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,360
So?

152
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Look whatever's wrong with you,
you have to get it together.

153
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,040
Listen to me.

154
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,080
Don't go out there.

155
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,240
What's your problem? Huh?

156
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,640
You want something to look at?

157
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,520
‘Cause I'll give you
something to look at.

158
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
We have got to get out of here.

159
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,440
I want to talk to them.
I want to talk to you.

160
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Argh!

161
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,880

I just want to see what
they're looking at.

165
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,320
I said put it down.

166
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,960

337
27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,840
(saw starts whirring)

338
27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,600
Argh!!

339
27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,080
Argh!!!

340
27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,000
(applause, cheering)

341
28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,120
Thank you.

342
28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,480
So.

343
:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,040
I guess you're wondering
why you're here?

344
:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,200
It's time to tell
you who you are.
345
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,240
You've looked better.

346
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,560
(laughter)

347
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
Do you recognise him?

348
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,640
Huh...Yes.

349
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,800
Your fiancé, Iain Rannoch.

350
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,240
Or should I say was your fiancé.

351
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,480
In case you haven't guessed the
pair of you aren't very popular.

352
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,520
But I'll tell you
what you are though.

353
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,160
You're famous.

354
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,840
(man) The trial
of Victoria Skillane finally

355
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,640
concluded today,
the verdict guilty.

356
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,440
Together with her fiancé Iain

had delayed the trial Skillane
abducted 6-year-old
Jemima Sykes

358
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,840
just miles from her home,
prompting a nationwide search

359
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,680
amidst emotional pleas
from her parents.

360
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,400
For months the youngster's
disappearance had been a

361
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,880
mystery, the sole clue
being her distinctive
white teddy bear,

362
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,640
discovered in a lay-by two
miles from the family home.

363
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,240
The white bear became an
enduring symbol in the hunt for

364
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,440
Jemima, a hunt that
ended in a local forest.

365
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,120
Jemima's body was found here.

366
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,280
It had been wrapped in a
sleeping bag and burned.

367
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,160
The couple were caught
after harrowing

368
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,920
footage of Jemima's torture
and murder was discovered on

369
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,960
a mobile phone in
Skillane's possession.

370
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,760
Tain Rannoch identified by his
distinctive tattoo, killed the

371
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,080
youngster as Victoria Skillane
held the camera.

372
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,000
Breaking down in
tears, Skillane admitted to
filming Jemima's

373
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,000
final moments, claiming her
fiancé had pressured her into

374
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,200
helping him maintaining
she was "under his spell".

375
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,480
The jury was not convinced by
Skillane's story

376
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,520
and neither
was the judge,

377
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,240
who labelled her a uniquely
wicked and poisonous
individual.

"You were an
enthusiastic spectator to

379
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Jemima's suffering. You
actively revelled in her

380
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,920
anguish" he said...adding

her punishment would be

381
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,640
proportionate and considered.
By hanging himself in his

382
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
cell, many believe
Tain Rannoch evaded justice.

383
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,320
The public mood is
now focused on ensuring his

384
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,080
accomplice can't do the
same. Patrick Lacey, UKN.

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,520
There were no tears when you
watched him do what he did.

391
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,600
You filmed what he did.

392
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,840
A poor wee girl.

393
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,200
Helpless and terrified,
and you just watched.

How do you like it now?

403
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,800
Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

404
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,200
Okay, we are at the
climax of our day.

405

Take as many photographs as you
want, take as many photographs

406
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,640
as you can, but most importantly
what I need from you is to shout

407
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,600
and scream and let that bitch
know that you are out here.

429

Help me!

440
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,440
(Jem) Okay, everyone, we're
about to head into the park

441
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,600
so I'll hand you
over to Baxter.

442
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,200
(applause)

443
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,240
Thank you. All of our
roles are very,

444
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,280
very important, yours included.
Now yours come with some

445
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,560
basic rules: Rule number one
"No Talking,” not just to her,

446
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,120
but each other as well.
Okay, unless it's essential.

447
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,560
What we're trying to do
is get her to believe that

448
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,760
you are all mesmerised.

449
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,400
(laughter)

450
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,480
I know, I know, I know but
she's believed it up to now.

451
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,800
Morning, ticket please.

452
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,760
Thank you.

453
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,480
(Jem) Okay, rule number two:
Keep your distance.

454
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,960
I can't stress the importance
of this one enough, okay.

455
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,200
Don't forget, she's a
dangerous individual.

456
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,280
Imagine that she's
an escaped lion.

457
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,320
Now yesterday she
threw a projectile.

458
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,400
And we will step in if
she gets too close, we're all

459
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,320
equipped with Tasers but then
we're into story shutdown and

460
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,840
we've all wasted a day. So
it's best to keep your distance

461
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,640
at least three metres back.
You can use your camera zoom.

462
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,840
Last but not least,
enjoy yourself. That's probably

463
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,280
the most important rule of all,
okay? Take lots of photographs

464
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,840
run around through the woods
but try and stay safe.

465
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,440
We'll be keeping an eye
on you making sure you're

466
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,520
all okay, so get out
there, enjoy yourselves and

467
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,120
let's make this show
happen, people. Come on!

468
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,600
Look, there she is.

469
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
(Jem) Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.

470
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,440
Me, too.

471
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
(Baxter) She's just leaving her
house now... two minutes tops.

472
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,960
Right you are.

473
